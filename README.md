###### A repository for learning and see solutions to some LeetCode problems in Python!

**It is divided in three main directories: one for easy problems, medium problems and hard problems (loading).**

I divided easy problems in:
- part 1 - easiest, where I suggest beginning if you are noob like me,
- part 2 - interesting, where there are some interesting problem, not so hard to implement if you understand
                    the structure of the problems
  
Inside each part I categorized the problems with the specific topic/data structure I used to solve the problem
(array, stacks, hashmap, etc.), which sometimes could not be the best or the only way.
